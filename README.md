# 🧪 LAB-OpenGL

> My structured OpenGL learning laboratory — documenting everything I study, experiment with, and truly understand.

---

## 📌 About This Repository

**LAB-OpenGL** is my dedicated learning space for modern OpenGL.

I like to document everything I learn in detail, so this repository acts as both my experiment lab and my technical journal.

Instead of rushing through tutorials, I break concepts down, test them independently, and write notes explaining how they actually work.

This repository contains focused experiments, structured notes, shader studies, and incremental graphics projects.

The goal is not to build a game engine immediately, but to understand how rendering truly works under the hood.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

* Modern OpenGL Core Profile concepts  
* Graphics pipeline architecture and data flow  
* Vertex Buffer Objects and Vertex Array Objects  
* Shader compilation, linking, and GLSL programming  
* Texture loading and mapping techniques  
* Model, View, Projection transformations  
* Depth testing and blending behavior  
* Framebuffers and off-screen rendering  
* Debugging OpenGL state machine issues

## 🧪 Learning Philosophy

* Document everything instead of relying on memory  
* Understand every line of code before moving forward  
* Keep one repository focused on one clear purpose  
* Build small experiments before attempting large systems  
* Treat mistakes as part of the documentation process  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* Build strong graphics programming fundamentals  
* Develop deep understanding of the GPU rendering pipeline  
* Prepare for low-level rendering system development  
* Create a documented knowledge base for future reference  
* Build foundation before exploring APIs like Vulkan  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* C++  
* Modern OpenGL  
* GLSL  
* GLFW or similar context library  
* CMake build system
